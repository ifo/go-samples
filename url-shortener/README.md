## urlshortener

A very simple url shortener written in Go, for use in a presentation about Go.
It has 4 different parts, which are checkpoints to move through while explaining what is happening.

`v4/main.go` is the end result.

### Running

You can run each url shortener with `go run main.go` from each individual folder.
The server runs on port :3030, so http://127.0.0.1:3030/ should be able to access it.
